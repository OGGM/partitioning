Many  glaciological applications(e.g OGGM) uses glacier outlines provided by the Randolph Glacier
Inventory (RGI) `Pfeffer et al., (2014)`_.
In some cases these outlines represent a "glacier complex" and not those of a single glacier.
This results in incorrect calculations especially as the model is developed to handle glaciers individually. Thus, a method seperating these complexes is required to
improve the modelling results as can be seeing in the following figure.
